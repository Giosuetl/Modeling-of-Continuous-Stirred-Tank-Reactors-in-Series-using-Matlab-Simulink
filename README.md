##### We assume that the density of the fluid is constant and the contents of the tanks are well mixed and isothermal:
####  dV1/dt = dV2/dt = 0
#### The reaction is taking place in both reactor:
#### A -> B
#### The reaction rate is :
#### -rA = kCA,    k=0.64 min^(-1)


#### Component mole balance:
